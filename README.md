Within this section of my GitHub I will be displaying personal projects that I have done over the years of my coding development and current live projects which could be on going at the time.
most of this will consist of basic Knowledge I have gained from studying within education and what I have learned in my personal time; their will also be demonstrations of my cybersecurity skills which are 
currently unederdevelopent (this could be demos on scripts to social engineering programs developed. These will not fully include parts of the code for security reasons to prevent public access using the code 
in a bad faith mannor.)
